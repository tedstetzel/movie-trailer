## Getting Started

The directions below will show you how to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for testing.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python (I built this project using V 2.7).  Check to make sure you have Python installed by running the following command.  

```
python -V
```
You can download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installing

cd to the directory that you've downloaded this repo to and run the entertainment_center.py file using python

```
python entertainment_center.py 
```

The file should automatically open a new web browser window with movies listed in that file displayed. 
You can update the python entertainment_center.py file in order to customize the page.
